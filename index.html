              <h2><strong>ATIVAN ADDICTION HELP</strong></h2>
              <p>It&rsquo;s easy to confuse symptoms of someone who requires <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">Ativan</a> addiction help with other types of substance abuse.</p>
              <p>For instance, some experts maintain Ativan addiction is very similar to <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/alcohol-everywhere-legal-drug">alcohol addiction</a> in appearance.</p>
              <p>But in all honesty, Ativan addiction has its own set of issues that are not in the least bit related to alcohol.</p>
              <p>This is why Ativan addiction help is so critical when someone is found to be abusing the drug. Intervention has to occur almost immediately if Ativan addiction is suspected.</p>
              <h2><strong>THE DANGERS OF ATIVAN</strong></h2>
              <p>Ativan is one of the most potent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/benzodiazepines-anti-anxiety-addiction-rolled-one">benzodiazepines</a> available. Because the drug is so powerful, there is a higher risk of developing a physical dependence on Ativan than other drugs.</p>
              <p>In fact, a person who simply follows their doctor&rsquo;s instructions while taking Ativan, can find themselves addicted to the drug.</p>
              <p>This is why it is recommended by addiction and medical experts as well as Ativan manufacturers that a patient who has been put on Ativan not be prescribed the drug longer than two weeks to help avoid a potential addiction.</p>
              <h2><strong>SIGNS THAT THERE MAY BE AN ATIVAN ISSUE</strong></h2>
              <p>Signs that someone may be suffering Ativan abuse can include the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                <li>Headaches</li>
                <li>Tremors</li>
                <li>Sweating</li>
                <li>Confusion</li>
                <li>Hallucinations</li>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                <li>Dizziness              </li>
              </ul>
              <h2><strong>HOW TO AVOID AN ATIVAN HABIT</strong></h2>
              <p>If you feel you have a penchant, or at least a fear you might become addicted to Ativan, especially when it is prescribed to you, double check with your doctor to make certain the prescription won&rsquo;t have an adverse effect on you, such as addiction.</p>
              <p>Another way to avoid a dependence on Ativan is to continually remind yourself of the drug&rsquo;s power, and that taking it for too long a period can result in your own dependence on the drug.</p>
              <p>The last, and possibly best way to avoid an Ativan habit is to seek out alternative medications and/or activities that can possibly replace the drug.</p>
              <p>Remember, Ativan is an anti-anxiety medication that helps you in uncomfortable situations that you might find stressful. The drug is also prescribed for those who suffer from narcolepsy,              </p>
              <h2><strong>THE NEXT STEP</strong></h2>
              <p>Sensing that you or a loved one may have an addiction problem with Ativan is the first step. The next step is doing something about that potential addiction.</p>
              <p>Locate and consult a reputable <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/">treatment center</a> whose staff can give advice as to the type of treatment you or some close to you might need. Cases can vary from inpatient services to something less intense such as outpatient counseling that occurs a few times a week. </p>
              <p>Going this route with your rehabilitation is more comprehensive. It is also more likely to succeed in the long run.</p>
              <p>If in the least, you&rsquo;ll be in a safe and controlled environment, which considering the danger and gravity of an Ativan addiction, may not be such a bad proposal in order to regain your health. </p>
